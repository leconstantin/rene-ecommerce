          beautiful 😍 It is beyond my expectations. I love the comfort, the
          quality and fit. The red was true ruby red. I have purchased red items
          in the past that was not truly red but rather pinkish. My Comfy
          sweatshirt matches my red lipstick. I purchased the one with the eye
          visor/ mask. I can't wait to fly somewhere.`,
